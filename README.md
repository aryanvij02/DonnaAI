**Donna AI** is an innovative AI-powered assistant designed to enhance your productivity by keeping track of your activities and providing relevant information precisely when you need it. Watch the introductory video [here](https://youtu.be/5CYa53B0_7Y).

## Features

**Donna AI** offers a unique blend of advanced technologies and user-friendly features:

- **AI-Powered Context Awareness**: Leveraging Apple's ScreenCaptureKit and OCR, Donna AI keeps track of your screen activities and understands the context of your work.
- **Contextual Storage and Retrieval**: All captured content is stored in a vector database, and Donna AI uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch and send relevant information to your prompts.
- **Seamless Integration**: Donna AI lives unobtrusively in the taskbar of your Mac, always ready to assist without disrupting your workflow.
- **Privacy-Aware Operations**: Privacy is paramount. Donna AI automatically turns off when it detects certain triggers, such as banking information, ensuring your sensitive data remains secure.
- **Local Processing**: All operations are performed locally on your device until you explicitly allow information to be sent externally, guaranteeing your privacy and data security.
